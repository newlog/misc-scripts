Python script to class
======================

Convert python scripts into python classes. Are you tired of converting the scripts you find into classes that you can use in your 'serious' programs? This script will set you up.

Do you know those moments when you think "Hey, I will write a code snippet in one hour or so and I'll be able to use it always. Yes! I won't waste my time anymore!"?

Yes, of course you know what I mean. But you also know that that hour turns to be two, three, four or ten hours. Well that was my case.

I publish the code so as to you don't waste your time.

Usage
------

It's as simple as:

    $ ./script_to_class.py 
    Usage: ./script_to_class.py <script_file>

A simple example such as this:

    $ ./script_to_class.py script.py

Would create a `class` folder with a `script.py` file converted to a class.

Enjoy!
