Configuration Scripts for System Customization
==============================================

Here there are many configuration files that I'm tired 
of configuring again and again.

+ `bash`: The bashrc definition. The only valuable change are the colors and format of the prompt line (a.k.a PS1 variable).
+ `vim`: The vimrc definition and definition of the directory structure, in addition to the colorscheme files. Lot of customization from several sources. Final result: awesome :)
+ `vim-python`: A fully vim configuration to implement a Python IDE. Plugins: python-mode, jedi-vim, ctrl-p, vim-powerline.
+ `tmux`: Tmux configuration file. Some handy shortcuts, such as using - and | to split into panes.
