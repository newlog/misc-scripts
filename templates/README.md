Python Utility Classes
================

In this repository you will find several classes that implement the typical used functionalities when programming python software. 

The day came when I was bored of programming always the same shit! If you felt the same, feel free to use and improve this code.

Right now the utilities are divided as follows:

+ `file_utils`: read and write all files in different ways.
+ `os_utils`: create, remove and list files and folders, get system date...
+ `http_utils`: make http requests and retrieve data.

Enjoy your time programming for fun and profit, and stop wasting your time with boring tasks!
